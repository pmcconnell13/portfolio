          I spent 2015-2020 traveling the world, working as a Dive Master in Australia, a Yoga instructor in Asia, and a luxury cycling guide in Europe. I met many Software Engineers along my journey and loved the potential to positively impact the world at scale. In 2020, my curiosity got the best of me and I dove head first into learning everything I could about coding. I haven't looked back since, and can't wait to join a progressive team looking to bring conscious change to the world.
